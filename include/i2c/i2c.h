/**
 * struct i2c_msg - an I2C transaction segment beginning with START
 *
 * An i2c_msg is the low level representation of one segment of an I2C
 * transaction. It is visible to drivers in the @i2c_transfer()
 * procedure and to I2C adapter drivers through the
 * @i2c_adapter.@master_xfer() method.
 *
 * All I2C adapters implement the standard rules for I2C transactions.
 * Each transaction begins with a START. That is followed by the
 * slave address, and a bit encoding read versus write. Then follow
 * all the data bytes, The transfer terminates with a NAK, or when all
 * those bytes have been transferred and ACKed. If this is the last
 * message in a group, it is followed by a STOP. Otherwise it is
 * followed by the next @i2c_msg transaction segment, beginning with a
 * (repeated) START.
