	bool "Verify NAND page writes"
	help
	  This adds an extra check when data is written to the flash. The
	  NAND flash device internally checks only bits transitioning
	  from 1 to 0. There is a rare possibility that even though the
	  device thinks the write was successful, a bit could have been
	  flipped accidentally due to device wear or something else.

	bool "Enable chip ids for obsolete ancient NAND devices"
	default n
	help
	  Enable this option only when your board has first generation
	  NAND chips (page size 256 byte, erase size 4-8KiB). The IDs
	  of these chips were reused by later, larger chips.
