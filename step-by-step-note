1.Try out the original code
	# make with the default config
	cp arch/arm/configs/friendlyarm_tiny210_defconfig .config
	make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi- menuconfig
	make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi-
	# write image to SD card, and boot from SD
	sudo dd if=./barebox.s5p of=/dev/sdb bs=512 seek=1
2.Add dm9000 network support
	# set ipaddress on your target board
	eth0.ipaddr=192.168.0.100                                             
	eth0.netmask=255.255.255.0                                            
	# ping your laptop
	ping 192.168.0.10                                                     
		=>host 192.168.0.10 is alive 
3.Switch to new environment
	# ipaddress is set in arch/arm/boards/friendlyarm-tiny210/env/network/eth0 
	# tftp file system is auto mounted under /mnt/tftp, you can't ls that dir or use tab to auto complete file names
	# on your laptop, echo 'hello world!'> ~/tftp/hello.txt
	# on the target board, cat /mnt/tftp/hello.txt
		=>hello world!
4.Support skip lowlevel init
	# by disable "General settings -> run machine low-level init", you can skip lowlevel init
	# then the barebox.bin can be used as a second stage bootloader
	# put barebox.bin into ~/tftp/ on your laptop
	# on the target boared: cp /mnt/tftp/barebox.bin /dev/ram0 && go /dev/ram0
5.Add SLC NAND support
	# BUG in function mtdraw_read_unaligned() in file drivers/mtd/mtdraw.c
	# INIT ops.ooboffs to zero, to slove nand_transfer_oob() issue in file drivers/mtd/nand/nand_base.c
	# BUG in function mtd_ioctl() in file drivers/mtd/mtdraw.c
	# CHANGE mtd_ioctl(), to slove ioctl function problem in mtdraw & mtdoob devices 
	# ADD SLC driver for both 1-bit & 8-bit ECC, select 8-bit ECC by define CONFIG_S3C_NAND_USE_8BIT_ECC in nand_s5vp210.c	
	# ADD nanddump command to read & print 1 page nand data, see commands/nanddump.c for more
	# TO test the nand driver, make and load barebox.bin to sdram, then use nandtest & nanddump commands
	# write random data to the 17th (0x220000 / 0x20000) block, then read out and check if it's right	
	nandtest -o 0x220000 -l 0x20000 -s 2 -t dev/nand0
	# Read out the 17th block with ecc check	
	nanddump -b 17 -d /dev/nand0
	# Read out the oob data of the 17th block
	nanddump -b 17 -o
	# Read out the raw data of the 17th block
	nanddump -b 17 -r
