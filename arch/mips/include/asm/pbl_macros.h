	 * like MIPS' B/BAL insns. When ARM makes PC-relative jumps,
	 * it uses ADR insn. ADR is used to get a destination address
	 * of 'label' against current PC. With this, ARM can safely
	 * make PC-relative jumps.

	 * 11.2.2 Stack Argument Structure in o32
	 * ...
	 * At the point where a function is called, sp must be
	 * eight-byte-aligned, matching the alignment of the largest
	 * basic types -- a long long integer or a floating-point double.
	 * The eight-byte alignment is not required by 32-bit MIPS integer
	 * hardware, but it's essential for compatibility with CPUs with
	 * 64-bit registers, and thus part of the rules. Subroutines fit
	 * in with this by always adjusting the stack pointer by a multiple
	 * of eight.
	 * ...
	 * SGI's n32 and n64 standards call for the stack to be maintained
	 * with 16-byte alignment.
